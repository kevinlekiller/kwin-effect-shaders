/**
 * Levels version 1.2
 * by Christian Cann Schuldt Jensen ~ CeeJay.dk
 *
 * Allows you to set a new black and a white level.
 * This increases contrast, but clips any colors outside the new range to either black or white
 * and so some details in the shadows or highlights can be lost.
 *
 * The shader is very useful for expanding the 16-235 TV range to 0-255 PC range.
 * You might need it if you're playing a game meant to display on a TV with an emulator that does not do this.
 * But it's also a quick and easy way to uniformly increase the contrast of an image.
 *
 * -- Version 1.0 --
 * First release
 * -- Version 1.1 --
 * Optimized to only use 1 instruction (down from 2 - a 100% performance increase :) )
 * -- Version 1.2 --
 * Added the ability to highlight clipping regions of the image with #define HighlightClipping 1
 *
 * Ported to glsl by kevinlekiller 2022
